label missing: #113 has no `ci-change` label (checked 2026-10-17 with `gh issue view 113 --json labels`), so the trigger-only deploy.yml edit from 9aae00f is not re-applied; deploy-workflow.spec.ts stays red until it is.
# Questions / follow-ups for #186 (CI config is owner-only, so nothing was changed there)

1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml:325` runs `docker exec mizano-api npx prisma db seed ... || true` after
   every production rollout. With this guard (container `NODE_ENV=production`) that step now prints the
   refusal and exits 1, which `|| true` swallows, so deploys keep working and no demo admin is created.
   Decision needed: leave as is (recommended, the intended outcome of #186), or remove the now-pointless
   seed step from the workflow, or export `SEED_ALLOW_PROD=1` there if a production seed is still wanted.
2. The issue text says `npm run seed`, but `apps/api/package.json` only had `prisma.seed`, no `seed` script.
   Added `"seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"` so `pnpm --filter api seed` works as the acceptance criteria state.
